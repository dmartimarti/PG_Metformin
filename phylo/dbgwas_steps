# Steps to get the right tables to make DBGWAS work

####
## 1. go to the computer location where the worm/bacteria info is
####


# for mac
cd /Users/danmarti/Documents/MRC_postdoc/Pangenomic/pangenome_analysis/ALL/worm_imaging 

# The RStudio session there has all the necessary info to get these tables done
# once you have finished creating the table, copy the file into the gwas folder
cp dbgwas_biofilm_PG.txt ../phylo_analysis/dbgwas/biofilm/


####
## 2. quality check of filenames within species names in the tree file
####

# go to the dbgwas location 
cd /Users/danmarti/Documents/MRC_postdoc/Pangenomic/pangenome_analysis/ALL/phylo_analysis/dbgwas

# there is a species.csv file there, if you have produced a different newick tree, I recommend 
# to run the Python script extract_sp_nwk.py to get the species names

python extract_sp_nwk.py tree.newick

# get the IDs and names from the tree file
awk  'NR>1{print $1}' biofilm/dbgwas_biofilm_PG.txt > query_names.txt
awk '{print $1}' species.csv > tree_names.txt

# one liner to get the difference in the set of query/tree names
R -e 'library(tidyverse); library(readr); query = read_csv("query_names.txt", col_names=F); tree = read_csv("tree_names.txt", col_names=F); print(dim(setdiff(query, tree))[1])'
# clean temp files
rm tree_names.txt && rm query_names.txt


####
## 3. copy files into the HPC
####

# if not connected to the folder, use this command
scp biofilm/dbgwas_biofilm_PG.txt dmarti14@login.hpc.imperial.ac.uk:/rds/general/user/dmarti14/home/pangenome_study/dbgwas


####
## 4. Check existence of fasta files in the HPC
####


# go to the HPC location where you are going to run the dbgwas analysis
cd /rds/general/user/dmarti14/home/pangenome_study/dbgwas

# to check that all fasta files are present in the fasta folder, run the bash script
sh ./check_files.sh dbgwas_biofilm_PG.txt

# if the output only tells you "Check done!", all fasta files are present in the folder
# otherwise, check which ones you need to change

####
## 5. Submit the job to the cluster
####

qsub DBGWAS_biofilm_jen.pbs
